## 📖 Project Overview

ShikshaAI is an advanced, voice-enabled AI teaching assistant built to revolutionize digital learning. Designed primarily for school students (Classes 5 to 10), it acts as a personalized, patient, and knowledgeable teacher. 

By simply speaking or typing a topic, students receive structured, NCERT-aligned explanations, beautiful visual aids, and interactive quizzes. ShikshaAI supports multiple languages (English, Hindi, and Hinglish) and provides spoken feedback, making it an excellent tool for self-learning, smart classrooms, and accessible education.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The core of ShikshaAI relies on a robust pipeline that routes user queries, fetches relevant content via LLM, and orchestrates visualizations and audio before presenting the final result.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Language** | Python 3.10+ |
| **Frontend UI** | Streamlit, HTML/CSS |
| **Core LLM** | Groq API (Llama 3.3-70b-versatile, Llama 3.1-8b-instant) |
| **Speech-to-Text** | Groq Whisper (whisper-large-v3-turbo) |
| **Text-to-Speech** | Edge-TTS (`en-IN-NeerjaNeural`, `hi-IN-SwaraNeural`) |
| **Visualizations** | Mermaid.js, Wikimedia API |
| **Audio Processing** | Pydub, Streamlit-Audiorecorder |

## 🚀 Working Pipeline

1. **User Input:** The user asks a question via microphone or text input. If audio is provided, it is transcribed using the Groq Whisper model.
2. **Intent Classification:** Python heuristic matching (with a fallback lightweight LLM) determines if the user wants an explanation, quiz, comparison, homework help, etc.
3. **Prompt Generation:** The `prompt_builder` constructs a system prompt enforcing the teacher persona, NCERT rules, output JSON schema, visual requirements, and language constraints.
4. **LLM Execution:** The query is sent to the Groq API. A retry wrapper with model fallback ensures reliability.
5. **JSON Validation:** The LLM's response is aggressively parsed, repaired (if needed), and validated against strict schemas (`_EXPLANATION_REQUIRED` or `_QUIZ_REQUIRED`).
6. **Visual & Audio Generation:** 
    * The `visual_manager` parses the requested `visual_type` and routes it to the corresponding generator (Mermaid, HTML Infographics, or Wikimedia).
    * `edge-tts` asynchronously generates the spoken audio script.
7. **Rendering:** Streamlit routes to the appropriate page (`pg_notes.py` or `pg_quiz.py`) and renders the rich, interactive UI.

## 🖼️ Visual Learning System

ShikshaAI utilizes a multi-layered approach to provide the best possible visual aid for any given topic:

*   **Wikimedia Images:** Fetches highly relevant labeled diagrams and SVGs for anatomical or geographical topics (e.g., Human Heart, Solar System).
*   **Mermaid.js Diagrams:** Dynamically creates flowcharts, mindmaps, and classification trees for processes and hierarchical concepts.
*   **HTML Infographics:** Renders beautiful, step-by-step numbered infographic cards for sequential processes.
*   **Comparison Cards:** Creates side-by-side interactive cards to highlight differences between concepts (e.g., Plant Cell vs. Animal Cell).
*   **Timeline Cards:** Visualizes historical events or sequential discoveries in a vertical timeline format.
*   **Tables:** Generates structured numerical or categorical comparisons.

streamlit run app.py
```
The app will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

While ShikshaAI is highly capable, the current implementation has a few known limitations:
*   **API Rate Limits:** Heavy reliance on the free Groq API tier can occasionally result in rate-limit errors (though API key rotation and model fallbacks are implemented to mitigate this).
*   **TTS Dependency:** Edge-TTS requires an active internet connection and relies on Microsoft's Edge text-to-speech service, which may experience latency.
*   **Browser Audio Support:** The Streamlit audio recorder may have varying compatibility across different web browsers (Chrome/Edge recommended).
*   **Language Scope:** Currently, the system is strictly optimized for English, Hindi, and Hinglish.

---

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

Based on the current architecture, here are the planned, realistic improvements for ShikshaAI:

*   **Expanded Quiz Modes:** Introduce "Fill in the Blanks" and short-answer questions to diversify the testing formats.
*   **Study Notes Export:** Allow students to download their AI-generated notes and visualizations as neat PDF or Markdown files for offline studying.
*   **Session History & Profiles:** Implement user accounts or local storage saving to let students revisit past topics and quiz results seamlessly.
*   **RAG Integration for Syllabus:** Integrate basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) so the AI can strictly reference uploaded chapters or specific NCERT PDFs.
*   **Enhanced Multi-Lingual TTS:** Incorporate more regional Indian languages and dialects into the Voice Assistant pipeline.

---

## 🌟 Educational Impact

*   **For Students:** Provides an infinitely patient, 24/7 available tutor that explains concepts visually and conversationally, breaking down complex topics into digestible pieces.
*   **For Teachers:** Acts as a powerful classroom aid to quickly generate visual comparisons, impromptu quizzes, and structured notes on the fly.
*   **For Smart Classrooms:** Seamlessly integrates into digital projector setups, allowing voice-controlled visual teaching.
